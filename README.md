# 2-year Prognosis in Advanced Stage High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer: Selecting Features for ML-based Prognosis Prediction

This repository contains the code used to run the experiments used in paper A. Laios et al., "2-year prognosis in advanced stage high grade serous ovarian cancer: Selecting features for ML-based prognosis prediction" submitted to Cancer Control.

## Requirements

* Operating system: Windows, Linux or macOS
* Matlab v2020a (probably compatible with older versions)
    
## Steps to run the code

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Matlab
3. For the Feature ranking: 
    - Run the FeatureRanking.m script file to execute the chi-squared and the MRMR methods;
    - Run the FeatureSelection_RegularizationMethods.m script to execute the Lasso and Elastic Nets Methods.
4. For the ML prognosis prediction models, run the run_allMLmodels.m script.
